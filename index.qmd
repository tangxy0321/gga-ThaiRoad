This project involves conducting Spatial Point Pattern Analysis on road accidents within the city of **Bangkok, Thailand**. In this context, a hotspot refers to a specific location or segment of the road network with higher frequency of accidents.

The primary goal is to democratise geospatial data analytics. and our objective is to develop a user-friendly web application facilitating Exploratory Data Analysis, Spatial Points Pattern Analysis, and Network Constrained Spatial Point Pattern Analysis. Users with little or no coding experience, will be able to carry out these analyses without the need for coding and in-depth knowledge about the dataset. This allows usage of geospatial data for relevant studies or other purposes.
