    "text": "2. Problem & Motivation\nAccording to the 2018 Global Status Report on Road Safety by the World Health Organization (WHO), Thailand’s road traffic death rate was estimated at 32.7 deaths per 100,000 population. However, the serial report in 2023 indicated a reduction in the death rate related to road traffic to 23.7 deaths per 100,000 population. Despite this improvement, Thailand’s road traffic death rate remains significantly higher than that of Singapore. This great contrast in road safety between Thailand and Singapore has motivated our team to conduct a geospatial analysis on road accidents in Thailand.\nThough by using the Internet, anyone would be able to download, manipulate and analyse the same dataset to obtain valuable insights and patterns that cannot be detected through human eyes. Yet this method is not as suitable for individuals with little to no coding experience."

Signal (Ang et al., n.d.)\nThis project was done by our seniors with the aim to discover the network-constrained spatio-temporal patterns of traffic accidents Leeds, United Kingdom. The following four main analyses were explored in their project:\n\nNetwork Constrained Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)\n\nTo visualise and identify the road segments with higher intensity of traffic accidents\n\nNetwork Constrained K- Function\n\nTo determine if there is spatial correlation between accident points (i.e. dispersed, clustered or randomly distributed)\n\nNetwork Constrained Cross K-Function:\n\nTo determine if there is spatial correlation between accident points and variables selected using multi-type K-function\n\nNetwork Constrained Cross Pair Correlation Function\n\nTo determine if there is spatial correlation between accident points and variables selected using pair correlation function\n\n\n\n\n4.2. Detecting traffic accident clusters with network kernel density estimation and local spatial statistics: an integrated approach (Xie & Yan, 2013)\nThis study highlights the limitations in analysing traffic accidents through conventional Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) within a  two-dimensional space as accidents are often constrained to network spaces. As such, the authors proposed the use of Network Constrained KDE (NetKDE) as a more suitable approach. However, both approaches lack formal spatial statistical methods in determining the statistical significance of accident hotspots. In order to address these limitations, the authors proposed to integrate network KDE with local Moran’s I for hotspot detection so as to leverage the strengths of each approach."

Thailand Road Accident [2019-2022]\nThe Thailand Road Accident dataset, available in csv format, provides comprehensive records of traffic road accidents in Thailand, spanning from 2019 to 2022. It encompasses a wide range of information, including the dates, times, locations, weather conditions and road types. The data source is available here.\n\n\n5.2. Thailand - Subnational Administrative Boundaries\nThe Thailand Subnational Administrative Boundaries dataset is available in ESRI shapefile format. It comprises the administrative boundaries at various levels within Thailand, including levels 0 (country), 1 (province), 2 (district), and 3 (sub-district or tambon).  We will use this dataset to extract the boundary of Thailand. The data source is available here.\n\n\n5.3. OpenStreetMap road data for Thailand\nThe Geofabrik’s OpenStreetMap road data can be sourced from Geofabrik Download Server and is available in ESRI shape file format. It contains various layers such as roads, buildings and points of interest. We will be using this dataset to map out the road networks in Thailand. The data source is available here."

    "text": "6. Methodology\n\n6.1. Data Preparation\nWe will be performing data wrangling on the 3 datasets mentioned above so that we can perform our analyses, with the steps that we will take as follow:\n\n6.1.1. Thailand Administrative Boundary Data\n\nExtracting boundary of the whole of Thailand\nExtracting geographical boundaries of all the provinces\n\n\n\n6.1.2. Thailand Road Accidents Dataset\n\nSimplifying variables like cause of accidents and vehicle types into bigger subsets of categories.\nSimplifying variables like number of fatalities and weather conditions into a boolean value (True/False, Yes/No).\nExtracting key information like hour, month, or specific day of the week from the datetime variable of the accident into separate variables for temporal-related analysis.\nRemoving unnecessary data points that lie outside of Thailand by filtering it with the Thailand boundary data from above.\nDropping irrelevant fields like reporting datetime, agency, route name, and fields that are in Thai.\n\n\n\n6.1.3. OSM Thailand Roads Dataset\n\n\n\n6.2. Exploratory Data Analysis\nIn this section, we will be performing the following EDA:\n\nFinding out the basic distribution of traffic accidents, categorised by the different factors.\nLogistic Regression to find out the significance of each variable in determining whether an accident causes fatality.\nDiscover region specific info, like which reason has the highest accident rate, fatality rate etc.\n\n\n\n6.3. Overview of Main Analyses\nThe main focus of our project would be on Spatial Point and Network-Constrained Spatial Point Analysis. Here are the analyses and techniques that we will be employing:\n\n6.3.1. Exploratory Data Analysis\nWe aim to uncover insights into the severity and outcome of accidents, exploring whether certain areas or times exhibit a higher likelihood of fatal incidents. This in-depth analysis will not only enhance our understanding of the overall road safety landscape but will also provide crucial information for developing targeted strategies to mitigate the severity of accidents, ultimately contributing to a comprehensive approach to improving traffic safety in Thailand.\n\n\n6.3.2. 1st Order Kernel Density Estimation\nIn this segment, we will use 1st Order Kernel Density Estimation methods to further refine our understanding of traffic accidents in Thailand. These statistical techniques go beyond identifying hotspots by providing a nuanced analysis of the intensity and spatial distribution of accidents. The 1st Order Kernel Density Estimation will offer a smoothed representation of the overall accident density.\nBy employing spatial point analysis on the traffic accidents in Thailand, we can explore the geographical distribution of accident hotspots and identify areas with higher risk.\nNetwork-constrained Kernel Density Estimation (NKDE)\nWe will also explore the network-constrained spatial point analysis to gather insights into how the city’s road network contributes to accident occurrences, allowing for targeted interventions in critical areas.\nTemporal Network Kernel Density Estimation (TNKDE)\nIn addition to that, we will explore whether festive periods contribute to the occurrence of traffic accidents. By examining temporal patterns and correlating them with festive events, we seek to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing road safety during celebratory periods.\n\n\n6.3.3. 2nd Order Kernel Density Estimation\nIn this segment, we will use 2nd Order Kernel Density Estimation methods instead to further refine our understanding of traffic accidents in Thailand. The 2nd Order Kernel Density Estimation will allow us to capture variations and fine-tune our identification of high-risk zones.\nG/F/K/L Function\nComplete spatial randomness test\n\n\n6.3.4. Interactive dashboards using Shiny\nAs we hope that the findings from this study can ultimately enhance road safety in Thailand, we will be creating interactive dashboards to empower urban planners, policymakers, and traffic authorities to explore comprehensive analyses, including accident hotspots, temporal patterns, network influences, and key metrics, facilitating informed decision-making in doing so."
